indonesian_wordlists is a specialized collection of Indonesian-language wordlists designed for use in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges. It includes two carefully curated files:

- password.txt

    A comprehensive compilation of common and culturally relevant Indonesian passwords. This list is intended for password auditing, brute-force testing, and analyzing localized credential vulnerabilities.

- non_password.txt

    A clean list of standard Indonesian words that are not typically used as passwords. This wordlist is optimized for use in web directory fuzzing, file enumeration, and other discovery-based recon techniques.

This repository aims to provide security professionals with localized wordlists that improve the effectiveness and realism of security assessments in Indonesian-language environments.
